functiona1: Create one or multiple LUN’s.
Test case
	1. create 1 Lun
		Expected:LUN created successfully.
	2. create 0 Lun
		Expected:No LUN created(it depends on the LUN implement.maybe LUN created successfully but size is 0. if it is,then it is an invalid case)
	3. create 2 Lun
		Expected:2 LUN created successfully.
	4. create max number of Lun
		Expected:max number of LUN created successfully.
	5. create max number +1 of lun
		Expected:max+1 number LUN is supposed to create failed. proper error message will display.
function2:  Resize (expand) a LUN.
Test case
    1. increase Lun size from 0 to 1 (assume the min size is 0)
        Expected:it succeed.Lun size is set to 1    
    2. increase Lun size from 0 to max
    	Expected:it succeed.Lun size is set to max    
    3. increase Lun size from 1 to max +1
    	Expected:it fail,proper message displayed and Lun size still is 1
    4. decrease Lun size from 1 to 0
        Expected:it succeed,Lun size is set to 0    
    5. decrease Lun size from 0 to -1
        Expected:it failed,Lun size still is 0 and there is proper message display(it depends on LUN implement as upper said)    
    6. decrease Lun size from max to max-1
        Expected:it succeed,Lun size is set to max-1
function3:Export a LUN to a host. (I am not clear about this function. just list case as my current understanding)
Test Case
    1. Export a LUN to a host successfully
    2. Export a LUN to a host failed
    3. Export a LUN to a host when network is unstable    
function4:Un-export a LUN.(I am not clear about this function.is it undo the function3?)
Test Case
    1. Un-export a LUN successfully
    2. Un-export a LUN fail
    Expected:it display proper message and nothing will be changed   
function5:Remove an un-exported LUN
Test Case
    1. remove an un-exported LUN successfully
    2. remove an un-exported LUN failed
    Expected:it display proper message and nothing will be changed
    3  remove an exported LUN
    Expected:it failed,it display proper message and nothing will be changed
function6:Retrieve the information (size, export) of a LUN
    1. create min size of LUN. retrieve size of LUN
    2. create max size of LUN. retrieve size of LUN    
    3. retrieve export of LUN after export LUN
    4. retrieve export of LUN after unexport LUN
    4. retrieve both size and export of LUN
function7:Concurrent requests is supported.
function8:Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUN’s are created and exported
    1. use Jmeter to simulate the concurrent and performance test of LUN created and exported(such as 10 threads.Loop 100)
    2. implement mutilple thread to simulate the concurrent and performance test if there isn't web service application
    3. function8和function9一般是一起测。如是是关心最大的并发线程数，一般用Jmeter，
    通过改变线程数去发现瓶颈。如果是一个call需要的平均时间，一般是在代码里加log，根据log的时间差得到结果。
